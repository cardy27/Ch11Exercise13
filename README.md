This C++ program demonstrates class inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation through a simulated banking system. It includes a base class (bankAccount) and two derived classes (checkingAccount and savingsAccount) that model real-world account behavior.

The program allows users to:

Create checking or savings accounts interactively

Deposit or withdraw funds

Apply interest to their balance

Display detailed account information
